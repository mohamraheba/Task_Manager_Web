# To open the Task Manager please run "auth.html" file.

# In this project I created a Task Manager, using the knowledge and features that we learned throughout the semester - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
# This Task Manager allows users to sign in and sign up to the site and manage their tasks efficiently, providing features such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks. The app communicates with the MockAPI to store and retrieve task data.
